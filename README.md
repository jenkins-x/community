# Welcome to the Jenkins X Community

We value respect and inclusiveness and follow the [CDF Code of Conduct](https://jenkins-x.io/community/code_of_conduct/) in all interactions.

Join us on [Slack](https://jenkins-x.io/community/#slack), and during [Office Hours](https://jenkins-x.io/community/#office-hours) to ask questions and tell us what you are building.
Upcoming events are shown on our [Event Calendar](https://jenkins-x.io/community/calendar/) or announced on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jenkinsxio).

This repo contains information on joining and contributing to the Jenkins X community - improving docs, improving code, collaborating etc.

## Communication channels

Weâ€™d love to talk with you about Jenkins X and are happy to help if you have any questions.

### Slack

Talk to us on our slack channels, which are part of the Kubernetes slack. Join Kubernetes slack [here](https://slack.k8s.io/) and find us on our channels:

- [#jenkins-x-user](https://app.slack.com/client/T09NY5SBT/C9MBGQJRH) for users of Jenkins X

- [#jenkins-x-dev](https://app.slack.com/client/T09NY5SBT/C9LTHT2BB) for developers of Jenkins X

### Office Hours

Find out more about our bi-weekly Office Hours, where we discuss all things Jenkins X, and other events [here](https://jenkins-x.io/community/).

## Contributing

Please see our guides on:

- [Contributing Documentation](https://jenkins-x.io/community/documentation/)

- [Contributing Code](https://jenkins-x.io/community/code/)

We are aiming to increasingly coordinate and organise work on Jenkins X within SIGs.
These SIGs will be the go to point of contact for contributing to Jenkins X in their respective areas.

## Special Interest Groups (SIGs)

**Special Interest Groups (SIGs)** are persistent open groups that focus on a part of the project.

### SIG Guidelines

- SIGs must have open and transparent proceedings. Work and collaboration should be done in public.

- Anyone is welcome to participate and contribute provided they follow our Code of Conduct.

A SIG should describe its focus and purpose in a `README` file in the SIG folder in this repo (e.g. [sig-docs/README.md](sig-docs/README.md)).
Additionally, the `README`should include information on communication and meeting logistics.

## Proposing a new SIG

We welcome proposals for new SIGs. ðŸŽ‰

Proposals for new SIGs can be made via a [PR](https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx-community/pulls) on this jx-community directory, for discussion and feedback.

Please create directory for the new SIG in this jx-community directory with a `README` providing information about the SIG's focus, goals, membership, and meeting logistics.

Add your proposal, and a link to your PR, to our [Jenkins X Office Hours meeting notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wHdBlZAN-ndPELuBoM5HBnYiQLvcz92-euXne2mKOEI/edit#)
as an agenda item to discuss at the next Office Hours.
Discussion during the Jenkins X Office Hours is a great way to gather further feedback and support and attract additional collaborators.
