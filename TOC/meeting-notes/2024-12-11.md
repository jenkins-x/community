# Jenkins X Technical Oversight Committee (TOC) meeting December 11th 2024

## Participants

- Mårten Svantesson
- Archie Skeoch
- Matthew Mentlak
- Jordan Goasdoué

## Minutes

- Tekton Pipeline upgrade
  - Jordan has commenced the work with [upgrading tekton](https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/issues/8683)
- [Tekton Pipelines as Code](https://github.com/openshift-pipelines/pipelines-as-code): Starts using jenkins-x/go-scm
- Upgrade apps in jx-observability
  - Archie brought up that the versions in the verstion stream for observability are outdated (grafana, prometheus and so on). The problem is that upgrading those to the newest version might break things.
  - The consensus was that, yeah, sometimes you need to break things, but you should inform about it clearly.
- X
 - Nobody is interested in using our X account. So instead of replacing Twitter with X on jenkins-x.io we should remove Twitter.
