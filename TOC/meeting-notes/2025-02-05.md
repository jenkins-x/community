# Jenkins X Technical Oversight Committee (TOC) meeting February 5th 2025

## Participants

- MÃ¥rten Svantesson
- Roxanne Joncas
- Michelle Martineau
- Archie Skeoch

## Minutes

- Changing name of the Jenkins X project
  - [Previous naming ideas](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nNLSqoO1ixv-Znp60Z2whm-pyPRSigcW8DFWd8ryDaM/edit)
  - We are leaning towards renaming the project to just __jx__, maybe __jxcd__.
  - Since the names __jx__ and __jxcd__ is occupied on GitHub we would probably register jx-project. Similarly for domain name.
  - [Logo guidelines from Linux Foundation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12LtT8FDOZOM5hxLCEovSsUG-2aXgQsir69KA4vzMw2w/edit?tab=t.0)
