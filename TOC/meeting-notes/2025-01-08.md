# Jenkins X Technical Oversight Committee (TOC) meeting January 8th 2025

## Participants

- MÃ¥rten Svantesson
- Archie Skeoch
- Matthew Mentlak

## Minutes

- We are removing references to X (Twitter) from jenkins-x.io
- [Switch from Kaniko](https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx3-pipeline-catalog/issues/1564) is put on the roadmap
- [Proposal for improving templating of apps from quickstarts and packs](https://github.com/jenkins-x/enhancements/tree/improve_quickstart/proposals/gotemplate_for_quickstarts)
  - Will gather input from the community whether this is something that is seen as worthwhile to do
- Velero
  - Would be good to make integration with Jenkins X work again, especially to backup the persistent vaolume of vault. In Jenkins X 2 there was integration.
- The [website roadmap](https://jenkins-x.io/community/roadmap/) should essentially have a link to [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/jenkins-x/projects/23/views/1)
- Future breaking changes
  - There are defaults in our projects that for backward compability reasons hide good features from
    our users. These should be compiled so that we can do the changes when changing the major
    version or maybe when we change the project name.
