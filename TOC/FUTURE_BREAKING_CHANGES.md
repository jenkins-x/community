# Future breaking changes

There are defaults in our projects that for backward compability reasons hide good features from our
users. Here we list these so that we can do the changes when changing the major version or maybe
when we change the project name.

## Switch to kpt live apply from kuectl apply as the default reconciliation method

## Let reusePullRequest be the default in jx-promote

## Let reusePullRequest be the default in jx-updatebot
